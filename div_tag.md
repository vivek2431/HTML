# HTML Div Tag

The `<div>` tag is a block-level element used to create a division or section in an HTML document. It does not have any semantic meaning and is often used as a generic container for grouping and styling sets of elements.

## Usage:

- Grouping Content: `<div>` elements are commonly used to group together and organize sets of related content, such as paragraphs, headings, images, forms, etc.

- Layout and Structure: `<div>` elements are used to define layout structures within a webpage. They can be styled using CSS to control their appearance, positioning, and behavior.

## Example:

```html
<div>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image">
</div>
```
In this example, the <div> element serves as a container for a heading, paragraph, and an image. You can apply CSS styles to the <div> element to control its layout, 
such as setting margins, padding, borders, background colors, etc.The <div> tag is versatile and widely used for creating structured and organized layouts in HTML documents.
