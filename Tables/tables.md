# Tables in HTML

Tables in HTML are used to display data in rows and columns. They are structured using the `<table>` element, with additional elements such as `<tr>` for table rows, `<th>` for table headers (typically used in the first row), and `<td>` for table data (used in subsequent rows). Here's a breakdown of these elements:

- `<table>`: This is the main container element for the table.
- `<tr>`: Represents a row within the table.
- `<th>`: Defines a header cell in a table. It's typically used in the first row to represent column headings.
- `<td>`: Defines a standard cell in a table. It contains the data for each row and column.

Tables are useful for organizing and presenting structured data, such as product lists, pricing tables, schedules, and more. 
They provide a clear visual representation of data and can be customized using CSS to enhance their appearance and functionality.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Heading 1</th>
    <th>Heading 2</th>
    <th>Heading 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
    <td>Data 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 4</td>
    <td>Data 5</td>
    <td>Data 6</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
