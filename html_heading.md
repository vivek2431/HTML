# HTML Heading Tags

HTML heading tags are used to define headings or titles within a document. There are six levels of headings, ranging from
h1 to h6, each with decreasing importance.

- `<h1>`: Represents the highest level of heading, typically used for the main title of the page.
  Example: `<h1>This is a Heading Level 1</h1>`

- `<h2>`: Represents a level 2 heading, used for subheadings or sections within the document.
  Example: `<h2>This is a Heading Level 2</h2>`

- `<h3>`: Represents a level 3 heading, used for subsections or sub-subheadings.
  Example: `<h3>This is a Heading Level 3</h3>`

- `<h4>`: Represents a level 4 heading.
  Example: `<h4>This is a Heading Level 4</h4>`

- `<h5>`: Represents a level 5 heading.
  Example: `<h5>This is a Heading Level 5</h5>`

- `<h6>`: Represents the lowest level of heading.
  Example: `<h6>This is a Heading Level 6</h6>`

Headings are not just used for styling; they also provide structure and hierarchy to the content, which is important for accessibility and search engine optimization.

You can use headings to organize your content and make it more readable and accessible to users and search engines.
