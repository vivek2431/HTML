# HTML Span Tag

The `<span>` tag is an inline-level element used to apply styles or manipulate specific portions of text within a larger block of content. It does not have any semantic meaning and is often used for styling purposes.

## Usage:

- Inline Styling: `<span>` elements are commonly used to apply styles to small sections of text, such as individual words or phrases, without affecting the layout or structure of the surrounding content.

- Manipulating Text: `<span>` elements can be used in conjunction with CSS or JavaScript to dynamically modify or manipulate specific portions of text, such as changing the color, font, or background of certain words.

## Example:

```html
<p>This is <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> text.</p>
```
In this example, the word "blue" is enclosed within a <span> element with inline CSS to change its color to blue. This allows you to apply styling to specific portions of text without affecting 
the rest of the paragraph. The <span> tag is particularly useful for applying fine-grained styling or behavior to text elements within a larger block of content.
