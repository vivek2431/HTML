# HTML Basics

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It consists of a series of elements, which are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets. These tags define the structure and content of the web page.

Here's a basic example of HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example:
